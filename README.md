# magma

A Clojure library to back up your Firestore to Google Storage

## Usage

All magma functions have multiple arities for convenience and to be CI/CD friendly. 

Whenever the `project-id` is omitted as an argument `magma` uses the `project-id` in the Google Credentials.
`magma` uses [alekcz/google-credentials](https://github.com/alekcz/google-credentials) to load Google Credentials from the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`


```clojure 

[alekcz/magma "0.1.0"]

(list-firestore-backups)
(list-firestore-backups "project-id")

(last-firestore-backup)
(last-firestore-backup "project-id")

(backup-firestore)
(backup-firestore "gs://bucket-name")
(backup-firestore "project-id" "gs://bucket-name")

(restore-firestore "gs://bucket-name/yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS")
(restore-firestore "project-id" "gs://bucket-name/yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS")

(roll-back-firestore) ;for your safety magma waits 60 seconds before starting the roll back
(roll-back-firestore "project-id") ;for your safety magma waits 60 seconds before starting the roll back
```
